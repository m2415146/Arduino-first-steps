To complete the tasks, I will use the material that was provided to us in the classes at MISIS, as well as the training materials that are provided in the Arduino kit itself.

Following the recommendations from the manual, I installed the library (screenshot from the manual)

by default, I will use it if you need to install another library for some tasks, I will specify which one.

I will work with the microcontroller through the IDECOAGENT ARDUINO 2.3.4 program.

to check, I will use the "" command and observe if it in Serial Monitor

## 1. turning on the LED

We turn on the LED via Arduino Uno, using a breadboard, an LED and wires with simple commands.

first, we connect the LED via the breadboard to the Arduino uno as follows: the short leg to the GND output, the long leg to the digital pin number 12 through a resistor.
we use simple commands:

## 2. Adjust the brightness of the LED

let's try to adjust the brightness of the LED. we will use the components from task number 1. now we will connect the LED power from another pin - pin with a tilde - pin number 9.
